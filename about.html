      <div class="one">
        I am graduated in Electronics and Communication in 2022.I did my under
        graduation in College of Engineering,Guindy.I am currently an employee
        of Mphasis under the role of a Software Engineer. I am someone who
        prefers work to studies, but at the same time someone who never stops
        learning. I can code in C,C++ decently, as well as in Java, and want to
        learn Python and other languages.I prefer to study on my own, learning
        things I can realistically apply in doing what I enjoy doing for a
        livingâ€“programming.

        I would characterize myself as an active person.I love to train my body
        and mind to be focused.I keep myself physically fit by workouts and diet
        which i believe would help in achieving stability. During my Schooling I
        was an athelete where i learnt to be a team player and communication in
        a team work.

        During my college I got good knowledge on hardware language,verilog and
        assembly language where we code for microprocessors and
        microcontrollers. Also I am good at digital electronics which fascinated
        me on how a computer is built from the lower level.

        Being in a college like College of Engineering,Guindy taught me in
        various aspects of studying and development of skills other than
        acedemics. This developed a diverse knowledge on various fields.
